An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly **once**. For example, the word "binary" can be rearranged into "brainy".

---
       
You have been given the task to find the anagrams for a given sequence of characters (that we can call **word**)

You also have been given a list of all the possible **words** that you have to consider when searching for **anagrams** in the form of a *txt file* (see the test project)

----
# Problem Description
Write a function that given a **word** returns an array all its anagrams that you can find in the text file.
If none is find, just return the input.

No UI is required (Console application or similar), assume that the client is the **Test project** itself with its test cases, focus on the functionality/maintainability.

We are interested in the approach and in the way the candidate articulates the solution.
A fully working algorithm is not the requirement at this stage. 
Obviously, the more features you can add, the merrier! 

# Examples

| Input        | Output                    |
| -------------| -------------------------:|
| binary       | [brainy]                  |
| sunders      | [undress]                 |
| rots         | [sort]                    |
| enlist       | [inlets, listen, silent]  |
